      <h2>Gateway to the Subconscious</h2>

      <p>The main theme of my work has always been the connection and synergy of all living organisms.
        It’s symbolic of the delicate balance and inter-dependency of life.
        I see these interconnections as a perfectly choreographed dance where each element is singular, yet part of the
        whole.
        It’s a simple and timely message, and my hope is that the viewer recognizes this in my artwork and takes with
        them a sensitivity and awareness of all life forms on the planet.
        My art is a process. The physical act of drawing or painting taps into my creativity, and there are always new
        discoveries and surprises.
        I view this process as a gateway to my subconscious because it’s not analytical. It’s completely intuitive.
        I typically begin with an initial inspiration, such as an ancient bristlecone pine tree, or an exotic orchid, or
        even the structure of a single cell.
        Sometimes this initial inspiration is representational, and at other times it may become abstracted, or so
        stylized as to appear surreal.
        From that point on I trust in the creative process to lead me. I start every painting with a detailed drawing.
        The act of drawing is where most of my creativity happens.
        It’s like a stream-of-conscious where each new element leads to another, and the connections between them evolve
        – sometimes with surprising results!
