                <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                <p>The main theme of my work has always been the connection and synergy of all living organisms. 
                It’s symbolic of the delicate balance and inter-dependency of life. 
                I see these interconnections as a perfectly choreographed dance where each element is singular, yet part of the whole. 
                It’s a simple and timely message, and my hope is that the viewer recognizes this in my artwork and takes with them a sensitivity and awareness of all life forms on the planet. 
                My art is a process. The physical act of drawing or painting taps into my creativity, and there are always new discoveries and surprises. 
                I view this process as a gateway to my subconscious because it’s not analytical. It’s completely intuitive. 
                I typically begin with an initial inspiration, such as an ancient bristlecone pine tree, or an exotic orchid, or even the structure of a single cell.
                Sometimes this initial inspiration is representational, and at other times it may become abstracted, or so stylized as to appear surreal. 
                From that point on I trust in the creative process to lead me. I start every painting with a detailed drawing. 
                The act of drawing is where most of my creativity happens. 
                It’s like a stream-of-conscious where each new element leads to another, and the connections between them evolve – sometimes with surprising results!
